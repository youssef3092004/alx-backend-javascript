# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Description
This project covers various techniques and methods for manipulating data using ES6 features in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the use of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.
- Learn how to use the spread operator and rest parameters.
- Explore the use of `Set` and `Map` objects.
- Practice destructuring arrays and objects.

## Introduction
In this project, we will explore various ES6 features that make data manipulation in JavaScript more efficient and readable.

## Map, Filter, and Reduce
### Map
The `map` function creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

### Filter
The `filter` function creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

### Reduce
The `reduce` function executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

## Spread Operator and Rest Parameters
The spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected. Rest parameters allow us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

## Set and Map Objects
### Set
A `Set` is a collection of values where each value must be unique.

### Map
A `Map` is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that `Map` allows keys of any type.

## Destructuring
Destructuring assignment is a syntax that allows us to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

## Conclusion
By mastering these ES6 features, you will be able to write more concise and efficient JavaScript code for data manipulation.
